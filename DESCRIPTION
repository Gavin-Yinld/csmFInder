Description: This package is used for identifying pCSM loci from methylomes generated by single-cells or bulk tissues. For single-cell methylomes, a beta mixture model is used for divide the cells into two subsets with hypo and hyper-methylation states in candidate CSM regions. For regular datasets generated from bulk tissue or sorted cell populations, a Nonparametric Bayesian clustering is used to group the sequencing reads into hypo and hyper-methylated subsets, both of the two algorithms identify the 4-CpG segments with biplolar methylation patterns across two subsets as the pCSM loci.
