Description: This package is used for identifying putative CSM loci from methylation datasets generated by single cells or bulk tissue. For single-cell bisulfite sequencing datasets, a beta mixture model is used for divide the single-cell into two subsets with hypo and hyper-methylation states in candidate CSM regions. For regular bisulfite sequencing datasets, a Nonparametric Bayesian clustering is used to identify the 4-CpG segments with biplolar methylation patterns.
