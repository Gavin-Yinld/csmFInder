# csmFinder

# Introduction

csmFinder is an R package for identifying putative cell-subset specific methylation (pCSM) loci from methylation datasets generated by single cells or bulk tissue. For single cell methylomes, it uses beta mixture model to identify the genomic loci with bipolar methylation pattern across single cells. For bulk methylomes, a nonparametric Bayesian clustering algorithm is used for grouping the sequence reads into hyper- and hypo-methylated subset and determining the genomic loci with significant difference bwtween two subsets as so called pCSM loci. 

The package includes two main function modules, the first one identify pCSM loci from bismark output file. The other perform co-methylation analysis and extract eigen-pCSM loci from each co-methylation module.

# Current Features
* Generate 4-CpG segments from bismark extractor results
* Identify candidate segments covered by totally methylated and unmethylated reads (or single cells)
* Identify pCSM 4-CpG segments with bipolar methylation pattern
* Merge pCSM segments to pCSM loci
* Calculate methylation level in pCSM loci
* Co-methylation analysis to cluster pCSM loci with similar methylation pattern into co-methylated modules
* PCA analysis to extract eigen-pCSM loci representing methylation trend of ecah co-methylation module

# Installation
csmFinder needs the following tools to be installed and available in the `PATH` environment:
1.  [R](https://www.r-project.org/)(>=3.4.4)
2.  [python2](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (>=2.7.10), to process the bismark extractor results
3.  [bedtools2](https://github.com/arq5x/bedtools2) (>=2.28.0), to merge the overlapped pCSM segments into pCSM loci

In R console,
```R
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite(c("GenomicRanges","WGCNA"))
library("devtools")
devtools::install_github(c("PhanstielLab/bedtoolsr","Gavin-Yinld/csmFinder"))
```
# How to Use

## Step 1. Process bismark extractor result  to 4-CpG segment
Typically, bisulfite converted reads are aligned to the genome by processing alignments. `csmFinder` takes that methylation value per base information in each sequence read as input. Such input file may be obtained from `bismark` pipeline, a typical input file should in ".gz" compressed format and looks like this:

```
ST-E00523:376:HL7JTCCXY:4:1102:23054:14494_1:N:0:ATGAGCAT + chr1  3023890 Z
ST-E00523:376:HL7JTCCXY:4:1102:23054:14494_1:N:0:ATGAGCAT + chr1  3023859 Z
ST-E00523:376:HL7JTCCXY:4:1107:31730:36592_1:N:0:ATGAGCAT + chr1  3023890 Z
ST-E00523:376:HL7JTCCXY:4:1107:31730:36592_1:N:0:ATGAGCAT + chr1  3023859 Z
ST-E00523:376:HL7JTCCXY:4:1204:29305:15232_1:N:0:ATGAGCAT + chr1  3022537 Z
```
To generate the 4-CpG segment coordinate, another table seperated text file contains all the CpG sites in forward strand of target genome is needed.

```chr1	3021025
chr1	3021077
chr1	3021345
chr1	3021400
chr1	3021720
...
```
The 4-CpG segments could be extracted as follow:
In R console,
```perl
library('csmFinder') 
#get the demo dataset
bismark_result=paste(system.file(package="csmFinder"),"extdata/bulk_CpG_extract_file/demo.dataset.gz",sep='/')
CpG_ref=paste(system.file(package="csmFinder"),"extdata/CpG_plus.reference",sep='/')
#generate the 4-CpG segment
segment <- bismark2segment(files=bismark_result,CpG_file=CpG_ref)
#see what the segment looks like
segment[2:5,] 
                                    V1                    V2
2 chr1:3026187_3026278_3026310_3026413 0001:1;0101:2;1101:1;
3 chr1:3026278_3026310_3026413_3026420 0011:3;1011:4;1111:1;
4 chr1:3026864_3026883_3026895_3026926        0111:2;1111:1;
5 chr1:3026883_3026895_3026926_3026929               1111:3;
#the first column denotes the genomic coordinate of the segment, the second column denotes the methylation pattern of the segment, for example, "1111:3" means this segment covered by 3 totlly methylated reads in this genomic loci.
```
